This was a dish I came up with to satisfy some of those cravings in a mindful way, rather than constantly caving to my ultimate weakness: chips and salsa (which I would happily have eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The millet is hearty and filling, and the beans provide a good amount of protein and fiber, which helped keep me full...especially useful because I always seemed to be hungry.

{"description": "Long before I discovered my love of sashimi, I fell in love with the viscous, sweet taste of teriyaki. With anywhere from 300 to 700mg of sodium per tablespoon, however, teriyaki chicken from the local takeout is now out of the question. So, to meet my cravings, I let go of the original dish and focused on finding a substitute with a similar color, thick coating, and unique flavor. The low-sodium answer lay in tamarind paste—a sweet and tart concentrate made from tamarind seed pods. It is popular in Indian, Middle Eastern, and East Asian cuisines, and can even be found in Worcestershire sauce. Its acidic properties help tenderize meat, and in Ayurvedic medicine it is said to have heart-protecting properties.

{"description": "Creamy coconut tapioca pudding with glazed pineapple is one of the desserts I obsessed over when I lived in New York City and worked for François Payard. All of the cooks at Payard Patisserie spent our free time talking about the places we dreamed of going and the dishes we couldn't wait to try. One of the cooks told me about how Claudia Fleming, at the time the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, had created a dreamy tapioca that could not be missed. He was right—on one of my last nights in NYC, I was finally able to try it, and thereafter every time I went to visit NYC, I made a point of going back to order it again. Sadly, it's no longer on the menu, but I've channeled it here in this version.

The kids learned how to tap trees to make maple syrup, a process I'd read about but never seen in action. Frank was one of the campers, and he got to experience firsthand the old art of making maple syrup. \"You put tubes into the trees so the sap flows out,\" he says. \"When it first comes out of the tree, it tastes like sugary water. Then we went to the sugar shack where we saw the sap boiled down until it tasted like syrup.\" At the camp, I made this Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad for the kids. \"I thought it would taste really sugary, but it didn't,\" Frank told me. \"First I tasted the fish, then a hint of mustard, and then an aftertaste of the maple syrup.\" I love how the syrup adds sweetness and a beautiful caramelized crust to the meaty tuna steaks, while the sweetness of the pears in the accompanying potato salad balances nicely with the glazed tuna.", "title": "Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad ", "url": "http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/maple-glazed-tuna-with-pear-potato-salad-356230", "image": "http://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5609a78762fa7a9917c25b18/6:4/w_274%2Ch_169/356230_hires.jpg", "ingredients": ["1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons maple syrup (see Tip)", "Juice of 1 lime", "1/4 cup olive oil", "Four 6-ounce tuna fillets", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 cilantro sprigs", " maple-flavored syrups, which are typically made without any real maple syrup."], "directions": ["1.

Its scarcity (it takes some four thousand crocus blossoms to create an ounce of saffron) and the belief that it could be used to treat everything from wounds to the plague even caused the Austrians to go to war over the spice during the Dark Ages. This is at least one feudal folk myth that modern science has corroborated. Studies have shown that saffron has outstanding antibacterial and antiviral properties and also aids digestion. People sometimes balk at saffron's cost, but it isn't unreasonable when you consider its potency; this recipe calls for only 1/8 teaspoon, and as you'll see, a little goes a long way.
